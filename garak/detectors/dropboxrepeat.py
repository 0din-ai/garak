    """
    Detects hallucinations and divergence triggered by repeated token inputs.
    It identifies model instability by looking for excessive response length and repeated patterns in the output, which are common symptoms of destabilization from the repeated token attack.
    
    The associated probe works by finding UTF-8 strings that map to individual tokens in the model's vocabulary,
    then repeating these tokens thousands of times in a prompt. This repetition can cause the model to
    enter an unstable state, producing abnormally long outputs or falling into repetitive patterns.
